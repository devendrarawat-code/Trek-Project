          <p>
           Rishikesh has earned its title as the Adventure Capital of India thanks to its thrilling activities like bungee jumping, camping, river rafting, and more. Travelers from across the globe visit Rishikesh to experience world-class river rafting, known not just for its excitement but also for its safety. What sets rafting here apart is the presence of flat rescue sections after every rapid, giving river guides enough time to ensure the safety of their teams.

           Beyond adventure, Rishikesh is steeped in spiritual energy and natural beauty, nestled between the Ganges and the Himalayan foothills. The stretch from Kaudiyala to Muni Ki Reti is considered the heart of all adventure sports in the area. Shivpuri, famously known as the birthplace of river rafting in Rishikesh, hosted the first commercial rafting trip and remains the most popular starting point for the iconic 16 km Shivpuri to Rishikesh rafting run. It’s also home to one of India’s oldest and most trusted whitewater rafting schools.
